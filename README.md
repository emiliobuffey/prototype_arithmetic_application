# prototype_arithmetic_application
In this assignment, you will put the concept of reusability into practice by selecting an arithmetic library developed by one of their peers and integrating it into a prototype application. This exercise will give insight into the real-world application of reusability and the importance of well-documented, modular, and adaptable code. 

This was the outcome of the project after intergrating nicks arithmetic library https://github.com/HippieMagic/ArithmeticLibrary into my project.
