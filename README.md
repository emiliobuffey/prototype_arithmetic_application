# prototype_arithmetic_application
In this assignment, you will put the concept of reusability into practice by selecting an arithmetic library developed by one of their peers and integrating it into a prototype application. This exercise will give insight into the real-world application of reusability and the importance of well-documented, modular, and adaptable code.
